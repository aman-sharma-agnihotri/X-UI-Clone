# X UI Clone 

 ## X (Twitter) UI Clone using HTML and Tailwind CSS!
This project was a great opportunity to dive deeper into Tailwind CSS and explore its utility-first approach. Building the layout, ensuring responsiveness, and replicating the design helped me improve my front-end development skills and better understand how to create clean, modern user interfaces.

**Tech Stack Used:**
- HTML
- Tailwind CSS
