# X UI Clone 

Tasker, a lightweight and responsive ToDo & Task Manager built entirely with ReactJS. This project was not just about creating a task tracker — it was a deep dive into understanding React's component-based architecture and handling real-world features like local data storage and UI state management.

 ## 🔹 Tech Stack & Concepts Implemented:
- ReactJS with Hooks: Utilized useState and useEffect to manage the lifecycle and state of the application.
- LocalStorage: Enabled persistent storage of tasks, ensuring data remains intact even after refreshing the page.
- UUID (Universally Unique Identifier): Ensured each ToDo has a unique and consistent identifier.
- TailwindCSS: Used for building a clean, modern, and fully responsive UI.
- Modular Component Structure: Created reusable components for better code readability and scalability.

## 🔹 Key Features:
- Add, edit, and delete tasks with ease.
- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
- Toggle visibility of completed tasks.
- Automatically saves data to the browser's LocalStorage.
- User-friendly, clean, and responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices.
